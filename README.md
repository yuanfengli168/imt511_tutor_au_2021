# imt511_tutor_au_2021

**Greetings**:

Welcome to University of Washington Everyone!
I am the Tutor for IMT511, and you can call me Jacky!


**FAQ Sheets**

As discussed with Professor Joel Ross, I decided to make an FAQ sheet so that you can find solutions for the most common questions other asked whenever you need.
I will have a google doc and a markdown file on Github with the same contents and keep updating them over the quarter. (so you have a back up! ; D)

[Google doc's link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/189q83UXw-XK4bnWvD23SimMvjOD7jHG4lrHCPqXRcTs/edit?usp=sharing)



**Feed Back Form**

I have also created an anonymous feed back google form for you if you want to provide any feedbacks for my Office Hour! I really appreciate your help, and I will try my best to make the Office Hour more efficient and helpful, so I encourage you to provide your opinions!
