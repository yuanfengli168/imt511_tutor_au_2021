# imt511_tutor_au_2021

**Greetings**:

Welcome to the University of Washington, everyone!
I am the Tutor for IMT511, and you can call me Jacky!

**FAQ Sheets**

As discussed with Professor Joel Ross, I decided to make an FAQ sheet so that you can find solutions for the most common questions others asked whenever you needed.
I will have a google doc and a markdown file on Github with the same contents and keep updating them over the quarter. (So you have a backup! ; D)

[Google doc's link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/189q83UXw-XK4bnWvD23SimMvjOD7jHG4lrHCPqXRcTs/edit?usp=sharing)

[Github markdown link](https://github.com/yuanfengli168/imt511_tutor_au_2021/blob/main/FAQ_imt511.md)

**Feed Back Form**

I have also created an anonymous feedback google form for you if you want to provide any feedback for my Office Hour! I appreciate your help, and I will try my best to make the Office Hour more efficient and helpful, so I encourage you to provide your opinions!
