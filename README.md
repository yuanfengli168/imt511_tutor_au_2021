# imt511_tutor_au_2021

**Greetings**:

Welcome to the University of Washington, everyone!
I am the Tutor for IMT511, and you can call me Jacky!

**FAQ Sheets**

As discussed with Professor Joel Ross, I decided to make an FAQ sheet so that you can find solutions for the most common questions others asked whenever you needed.
I will keep updating it over the quarter!

**Feed Back Form**

I have also created an anonymous feedback google form for you if you want to provide any feedback for my Office Hour! I appreciate your help, and I will try my best to make the Office Hour more efficient and helpful, so I encourage you to provide your opinions!
